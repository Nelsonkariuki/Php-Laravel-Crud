## Project Title: Fuel Efficiency Prediction Using Vehicle Characteristics
### Researcher: Ronnie McLovin
### ORCID ID: 0009-0006-7325-8135
### Dataset: Vehicle Performance Data
### Metadata Standard: Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG) of vehicles based on a set of key characteristics such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration, model year, and origin of the vehicle. This prediction model aims to assist manufacturers and consumers in understanding the factors that most significantly impact fuel efficiency and to optimize vehicle designs for better performance.

Fuel efficiency has always been a major consideration for automotive engineers and environmental policy-makers. The growing concerns over fuel consumption, emissions, and energy sustainability make it imperative to develop models that can predict the efficiency of different types of vehicles accurately.

# 1. Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project contains various performance metrics and characteristics of vehicles. Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a vehicle, and the attributes represent different measurable properties.
The column names of the dataset are as follows:

•	MPG (Miles Per Gallon): The fuel efficiency of the vehicle, measured in miles per gallon. This is the target variable.

•	Cylinders: The number of engine cylinders.

•	Displacement: The engine's total displacement in cubic inches.

•	Horsepower: The horsepower output of the engine.

•	Weight: The weight of the vehicle in pounds.

•	Acceleration: The time it takes for the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (in seconds).

•	Model Year: The year the vehicle model was manufactured.

•	Origin: The country or region where the vehicle was manufactured (represented numerically, e.g., 1 for USA, 2 for Europe, and 3 for Japan).

The goal is to predict the MPG of a vehicle based on the other features in the dataset.

# 2. Data Dictionary
A data dictionary is an essential element in documenting a dataset, as it provides a clear description of each variable, the data type, and any relevant notes on the data values.
