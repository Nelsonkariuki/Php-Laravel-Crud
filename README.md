### ORCID ID: 0009-0006-7325-8135
### Dataset: Vehicle Performance Data
### Metadata Standard: Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon, MPG) of vehicles based on a set of key characteristics such as the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, vehicle weight, acceleration, model year, and origin of the vehicle. This prediction model aims to assist manufacturers and consumers in understanding the factors that most significantly impact fuel efficiency and to optimize vehicle designs for better performance.

Fuel efficiency has always been a major consideration for automotive engineers and environmental policy-makers. The growing concerns over fuel consumption, emissions, and energy sustainability make it imperative to develop models that can predict the efficiency of different types of vehicles accurately.

# 1. Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project contains various performance metrics and characteristics of vehicles. Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a vehicle, and the attributes represent different measurable properties.
The column names of the dataset are as follows:

•	MPG (Miles Per Gallon): The fuel efficiency of the vehicle, measured in miles per gallon. This is the target variable.

•	Cylinders: The number of engine cylinders.

•	Displacement: The engine's total displacement in cubic inches.

•	Horsepower: The horsepower output of the engine.

•	Weight: The weight of the vehicle in pounds.

•	Acceleration: The time it takes for the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (in seconds).

•	Model Year: The year the vehicle model was manufactured.

•	Origin: The country or region where the vehicle was manufactured (represented numerically, e.g., 1 for USA, 2 for Europe, and 3 for Japan).

The goal is to predict the MPG of a vehicle based on the other features in the dataset.

# 2. Data Dictionary
A data dictionary is an essential element in documenting a dataset, as it provides a clear description of each variable, the data type, and any relevant notes on the data values.

## Below is a description of each feature in the dataset:
•	MPG (Miles Per Gallon): This is the target variable representing the fuel efficiency of a vehicle, measured in miles per gallon. It is a continuous variable that we aim to predict using the other features.

•	Cylinders: The number of engine cylinders in the vehicle. This is an integer variable, typically ranging between 3 and 12 cylinders.

•	Displacement: The total engine displacement in cubic inches, indicating the engine's size. This is a continuous variable.

•	Horsepower: The engine's horsepower output. This is a continuous variable, but some values are missing, which may need to be handled during the preprocessing stage.

•	Weight: The weight of the vehicle, measured in pounds. This is also a continuous variable and varies significantly across different vehicles.

•	Acceleration: This variable represents the time, in seconds, that a vehicle takes to accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour. It is a continuous variable that indicates the vehicle's acceleration capability.

•	Model Year: The year the vehicle model was manufactured. This is an integer variable, with values typically ranging from 1970 to 1982.

•	Origin: The region where the vehicle was manufactured. It is a categorical variable represented numerically, where 1 stands for the USA, 2 for Europe, and 3 for Japan.

# Notes on Data Quality:
•	Missing Data: In some cases, values for Horsepower are missing. A strategy for handling missing data (imputation or removal) is necessary.
•	Outliers: Extreme values for variables such as Weight or Acceleration might exist and need to be checked.
•	Normalization: Features like Displacement and Weight may require normalization or scaling due to their large value ranges.
